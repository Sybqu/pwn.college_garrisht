# Reading Files
read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable, and get the flag! 
**flag**:pwn.college{4Y-Naekuyz-YpYgzNAZaAycs0ZQ.QXwIDO0wCOzAzNzEzW}




```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4Y-Naekuyz-YpYgzNAZaAycs0ZQ.QXwIDO0wCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ 



```
straightforward

spammed fortune for a while because it was fun but then well well
## What I learned
man command, takes other commands as arguments
The data for commands is stored in a centralized database within our system.
Using the path of the system does not work. Commands as arguments needs to be passed to get the details about the command.
Really helpful use PgUp PgDn to navigate ,h for help and q for quitting the man page.

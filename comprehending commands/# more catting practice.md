# more catting practice
retreiving the flag using absolute path without using the cd command
## My solve
'''
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by 
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it 
in the file /usr/libexec/neovim/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that 
directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/libexec/neovim/flag
pwn.college{wMJCNiCkiwPAiuP-9l7PqbybILe.QXwITO0wCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ 
'''
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wMJCNiCkiwPAiuP-9l7PqbybILe.QXwITO0wCOzAzNzEzW}
`


## What I learned

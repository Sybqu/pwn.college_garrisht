# Scripting With Multiple Conditions
For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

Takes one argument
If the argument is "hack", output "the planet"
If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
If the argument is "learn", output "linux"
For any other input, output "unknown"
**Flag:**  pwn.college{41DqBzrn-rE3GmAuot14naAnvyL.0FOzMDOxwCOzAzNzEzW}
    



```bash
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ touch solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > solve.sh 
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ echo ' if [ "$1" == "hack" ]; then echo "the planet" ; elif [ "$1" == "pwn" ] ; then echo "college" ; elif [ "$1" == "learn" ] ; then echo "linux" ; else echo "unknown" ; fi '
 if [ "$1" == "hack" ]; then echo "the planet" ; elif [ "$1" == "pwn" ] ; then echo "college" ; elif [ "$1" == "learn" ] ; then echo "linux" ; else echo "unknown" ; fi 
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ echo ' if [ "$1" == "hack" ]; then echo "the planet" ; elif [ "$1" == "pwn" ] ; then echo "college" ; elif [ "$1" == "learn" ] ; then echo "linux" ; else echo "unknown" ; fi ' >> solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ ./solve.sh learn
linux
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ /challenge/run
Correct! Your script properly handles all the conditions with elif.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{41DqBzrn-rE3GmAuot14naAnvyL.0FOzMDOxwCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ 



```

## What I learned
We can modify shell scripts to accept arguments. This makes them more useful
The script can access these arguments using special variables:

$1 contains the first argument
$2 the second argument
and so on..

If else loop.
Else if ladder.

# Building on Success
In this challenge, you need to chain the programs /challenge/first-success and /challenge/second using the && operator. Try running each command separately first to see what happens (which is that you will not get the flag). But if you chain them with &&, the flag will appear!
**Flag:**  pwn.college{0JpLIqYjXspYBrySW9aELY9Kwor.0lM0MDOxwCOzAzNzEzW}
`


```bash
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{0JpLIqYjXspYBrySW9aELY9Kwor.0lM0MDOxwCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ 

```

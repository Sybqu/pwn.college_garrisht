# Duplicating piped data with Tee
Use grep -v to filter out all the lines containing "DECOY" and reveal the real flag!
**Flag:**pwn.college{MFlw4xXeAcnPzgUoTT0qB_VcQyL.QXxITO0wCOzAzNzEzW}




```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee pwn | /challenge/college
Processing...
WARNING: you are overwriting file pwn with tee's output...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code 
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the 
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat pwn
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "MFlw4xXe"
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret MFlw4xXe
Processing...
You must pipe the output of /challenge/pwn into /challenge/college (or 'tee' 
for debugging).
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret MFlw4xXe | /challenge/college
Processing...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MFlw4xXeAcnPzgUoTT0qB_VcQyL.QXxITO0wCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ 

```
Followed the instructions straight up, not much trouble.
## What I learned
Tee command. Named after the t-splitter pipe. It duplicates data flowing from our pipe | to any number of files provided in argument. Helpful for debugging. You can pipe multiple times in the same command too :3

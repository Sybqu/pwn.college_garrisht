# Process substitution for input
Use process substitution with diff to compare the outputs of these two programs and find your flag!
**Flag:**pwn.college{8nxGozW0kI4P1uHUBgxueQtnLJU.0lNwMDOxwCOzAzNzEzW}




```bash
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ diff <( /challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
5a6
> pwn.college{8nxGozW0kI4P1uHUBgxueQtnLJU.0lNwMDOxwCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ ^C
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ 

```
Followed the instructions straight up, not much trouble.
## What I learned
substituting input.Linux is based on the idea that everything is a file. System provides file like access to most resources including input and output which we've seen.The shell allows us to use any utility that takes file arguments on cli and hook it to output. Not so surprisingly , we can hook output and input of programs to arguments. This is done via process substitiion by using " <(command}".
This command hooks output to a temporary file that it has created. This is just temporary and hence called a named pipe too,and has a file name

# Writing to multiple programs
Now it's your turn! In this challenge, we have /challenge/hack, /challenge/the, and /challenge/planet. Run the /challenge/hack command, and duplicate its output as input to both the /challenge/the and the /challenge/planet
**Flag:**pwn.college{Eu6_NvMMlJaIC6fQxTQvIl9ESqP.QXwgDN1wCOzAzNzEzW}


```bash
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and 
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.

Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here 
is your flag:
pwn.college{Eu6_NvMMlJaIC6fQxTQvIl9ESqP.QXwgDN1wCOzAzNzEzW}
```
Followed the instructions straight up, not much trouble.
## What I learned
substituting input.Linux is based on the idea that everything is a file. System provides file like access to most resources including input and output which we've seen.The shell allows us to use any utility that takes file arguments on cli and hook it to output. Not so surprisingly , we can hook output and input of programs to arguments. This is done via process substitiion by using " <(command}".
This command hooks output to a temporary file that it has created. This is just temporary and hence called a named pipe too,and has a file name.
Using process substitution for writing commands.
Using output process subsitiution for outputting to multiple commands. The process is followed systematically one by one.
Making a named pipe , inputting it into a command , and so on.

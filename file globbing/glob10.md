# Tab completion on commands
ab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

**Flag:**pwn.college{wyDt9G0_tWvibyCJHiZ3K1TziU3.0VN0EzNxwCOzAzNzEzW}






```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-24753 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wyDt9G0_tWvibyCJHiZ3K1TziU3.0VN0EzNxwCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ 


```

## What I learned
tab spam~~~~~~~
auto completion
using * can lead to unintentional errors.
Bash will auto-expand until the first point where multiple options spawn. When tab is pressed during this scenario, the plausible options are listed below , other shells may cycle instead of priting plausible options
<TAB> can also be used to auto-complete commands as well!

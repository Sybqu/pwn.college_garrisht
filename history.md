Command History
Navigate through the history to grab the flag
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8ovRtyNxSprQ6l5uts_eeEATn_Z.0lNzEzNxwCOzAzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{8ovRtyNxSprQ6l5uts_eeEATn_Z.0lNzEzNxwCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ 

```
Used the arrow keys to navigate through command history. The flag was provided in the history

## What I learned
Typing a command again and again can be tedious work.You can invoke a previous run command by using arrow keys to navigate the history

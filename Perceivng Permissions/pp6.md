# Permission Tweaking Practice
In this challenge, the /challenge/run program will give you the flag, but you must first make it executable! Remember your chmod, and get /challenge/run to tell you the flag!
  **Flag:**pwn.college{MwlZphZSKsOriXn8fgC4H7cirXO.QXwEjN0wCOzAzNzEzW}

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

# Interrupting processes
Try it here! /challenge/run will refuse to give you the flag until you interrupt it
**flag**:pwn.college{sH2aI4neSoP1o_MhGCvkGWoHUWi.QXzQDO0wCOzAzNzEzW}




```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sH2aI4neSoP1o_MhGCvkGWoHUWi.QXzQDO0wCOzAzNzEzW}
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ 

```
straightforward :33
## What I learned

holding ctrl then pressing c
